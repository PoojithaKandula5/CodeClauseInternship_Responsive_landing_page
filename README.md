A responsive landing page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes. It features a responsive navigation bar with a hamburger menu for smaller screens, a hero section with a full-screen background and call-to-action button, a features section showcasing key highlights in a grid layout, an about section with a brief description, and a contact section with a simple form. The project uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsive layouts with Flexbox and Grid, and JavaScript for interactive functionality like the mobile menu toggle.
